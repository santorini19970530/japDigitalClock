# Hi, I am a newbie of frontend web developing learner, and this is my Hello World project.
# :)
# I learnt C and OOP 15 years ago during my university life, and now wanna to jump into programming industry again to start my 2nd life.
# I am now still staying in the very basic level of javascript and CSS, though I have just completed my HTML study.
# :(
# This task is a small japanese-style clock task that can be set as my computer's scrensaver.
# When I leave my desk, I just need to press F11 in Chrome to protect my screen.
# The HTML file contains div panels,
# then made use of the css file to animate background colour (Taiwan style) and the font / div styles,
# and lastly fill in the dates, time digits by javascript.
# T.T
# As my aim for this task is to test how much programming skills I still remember, the focus is just the program the HTML and simple javascript part.
# So I am so surprised by the animination tag and the complicated positioning logic of CSS.
# Also this task only works for Chrome and Edge.
# Hope I can get rid of CSS diffidulties in my future tasks.
